Paris Trip OpenAI – Travel Assistant 🇫🇷🤖
📌 Project Overview
Paris Trip OpenAI is a Python-based travel assistant that uses OpenAI Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions about famous landmarks, locations, and must-see attractions in Paris.
The project simulates an intelligent travel guide capable of providing concise and useful information to tourists.
This project demonstrates:

Practical use of LLMs
Basic NLP-style interaction (question understanding & response generation)
Clean project organization suitable for academic evaluation and scholarships

✨ Features:
Uses OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)
Answers predefined travel questions about Paris
Maintains a conversation context
Simple and clear Python implementation
Easy to extend with NLP, RAG, or user input
🧠 Technologies Used:
Python 3
OpenAI Python SDK
Large Language Models (LLM)
Basic NLP interaction via prompts

▶️ Example Output

Q: How far away is the Louvre from the Eiffel Tower?
A: The Louvre is approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) from the Eiffel Tower by car.

Q: Where is the Arc de Triomphe?
A: The Arc de Triomphe is located at Place Charles de Gaulle in Paris.

Q: What are the must-see artworks at the Louvre Museum?
A: The Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Liberty Leading the People.
▶️Code Explanation (Simple)
llm_travel.py
Loads the OpenAI API key
Defines the LLM model
Initializes the conversation and questions
Imports LLM configuration
Sends questions to the model
Displays the answers
🚀 Future Improvements:
Add user input instead of predefined questions
Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Add real NLP processing (entity recognition, locations, distances)
Connect to external travel APIs (maps, weather, museums)
